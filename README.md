# CylinderDataAnalyser
## This is an aplication which was build to make life of household cylinder users easy With the help of IOT team we developed a device on which a cylinder can be kept and that will note the data of the cylinder Then with the help of thinkspeak the data will be sent in the form of Json and then we use that data to display in the application to the user.
### Once user login to the app by entering credentials the will see what is the percentage of gas left in their cylinder.They can even scroll the date menu that is their on the top of the screen to see that variation in the percentage of the cylinder.Moreover when the user go to the calander screen they should see the date picaker and by choosing the date they can see the gas percentage in their cylinder i=on the specific day.
